1 NOTE Harry's only cousin, he is described as a large blonde boy. He is comp
2 CONC letely spoiled, and he gets a horrible delight in bullying smaller kid
2 CONC s, and shows a complete lack of sensitivity; he is also a glutton.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Dudley has been thoroughly spoiled since birth, getting mountains of b
2 CONC irthday and Christmas presents and then throwing a tantrum because he 
2 CONC wanted more, being given two bedrooms in the house, never using one, a
2 CONC nd then screaming when it is given to Harry and generally given his wa
2 CONC y in almost everything. He shows the symptoms of a brat from his first
2 CONC  year itself, when a disgusted Professor McGonagall tells Dumbledore h
2 CONC ow she saw the toddler Dudley kicking his mother and screaming for swe
2 CONC ets.
2 CONT 
2 CONT A rude, belligerent and selfish boy, Dudley is quite an unlikable char
2 CONC acter, although he knows how to be polite when he wants to make an imp
2 CONC ression (notably when his father's business associate came for dinner 
2 CONC one evening). It can be inferred that he and Harry went to a private p
2 CONC rep school in Surrey together, where Dudley and his gang of bullies ru
2 CONC led the school, and where the rest of the students shunned Harry as th
2 CONC ey knew Dudley hated him. With each passing year Dudley was overindulg
2 CONC ed in every way by his parents, which eventually made his morbidly obe
2 CONC se and a careless student (he had reached the height and weight of a y
2 CONC oung killer whale at the beginning of the fourth book). Throughout the
2 CONC ir childhood together, Dudley would take any opportunity he could to h
2 CONC umiliate and torment his cousin, Harry. Unlike his cousin, however, Du
2 CONC dley has no powers outside of his brutishness.

1 NOTE Sirius was best friends with James Potter, Harry's father, and was als
2 CONC o friends with Remus Lupin and Peter Pettigrew. When the group discove
2 CONC red that Lupin was a werewolf, they studied secretly to become Animagi
2 CONC  in solidarity with Lupin, to keep him company during his transformati
2 CONC ons.
2 CONT 
2 CONT When the Potters went into hiding from Voldemort, they wanted to make 
2 CONC Sirius their Secret-Keeper, but at the last minute he convinced them t
2 CONC o appoint Pettigrew to the task instead, since no one would suspect su
2 CONC ch a move. Pettigrew immediately betrayed the Potters to Voldemort, an
2 CONC d during the subsequent confrontation with Sirius, caused an explosion
2 CONC  to fake his own death, killing twelve nearby Muggle bystanders in the
2 CONC  process. Sirius was left framed for Pettigrew's "murder" and those of
2 CONC  the bystanders, as well as the Potters' betrayal. In light of the ove
2 CONC rwhelming evidence against him, his guilt was assumed so completely (i
2 CONC n particular by the ruthless Barty Crouch) that he was sent straight t
2 CONC o Azkaban without trial and imprisoned there for twelve years, during 
2 CONC which he endured relentless mental torture at the hands of the Azkaban
2 CONC  guards, the dementors.
2 CONT 
2 CONT His later escape from prison led to the widest manhunt ever in the wiz
2 CONC arding world (being the first person known to have escaped Azkaban, th
2 CONC ough in reality, he is second to Barty Crouch, Jr.), and he fled Europ
2 CONC e for a time, only to return on Dumbledore's orders in The Order of th
2 CONC e Phoenix, where he was forced to stay in his old family home, Grimmau
2 CONC ld Place. It was impossible for The Order to reveal his location and p
2 CONC rove him innocent for various reasons. His death at the end of The Ord
2 CONC er of the Phoenix, in the Ministry itself, led to Dumbledore explainin
2 CONC g his story to the Minister of Magic. Tragically, Sirius was only reco
2 CONC gnized as innocent after his death.

2 CONC , but not without making snide remarks about Neville Longbottom and Lu
2 CONC na Lovegood, whom she considers "uncool." Harry stands up for his frie

2 CONC k Harry into taking a love potion, but while he takes the box of choco
2 CONC lates she gives him, he is wise enough not to eat them. Several months
2 CONC  later, Ron Weasley accidentally eats several of Romilda's doctored ch
2 CONC ocolates and is affected by the love potion, forcing Harry to take him
2 CONC  to Professor Slughorn for an antidote - which leads to Ron being pois
2 CONC oned by accident. Following Gryffindor's Quidditch victory towards the

2 CONC ly mistaken for. Peeves is essentially an embodiment of disorder, and 
2 CONC is constantly causing it, with varying amounts of mischievousness and 
2 CONC malice. In appearance he's a small old man dressed in wildly coloured 
2 CONC clothing. He's capable of flight and intangibility, like ghosts, but c
2 CONC an also affect solid objects and make himself invisible.
2 CONT 
2 CONT He's usually far more annoying than legitimately dangerous, but acts i
2 CONC n a wildly unpredictable manner and should not be given the chance to 
2 CONC cause serious harm. It appears that his entire purpose is to cause dis
2 CONC order, break things, and be as annoying and disruptive as possible.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Peeves does not listen to Hogwarts prefects, teachers or anyone else, 
2 CONC with the exception of Dumbledore and for some unknown reason the fears
2 CONC ome Bloody Baron. Argus Filch, who is usually left with cleaning up th
2 CONC e mess and the damage Peeves causes, is his nemesis and works continuo
2 CONC usly to try to get Peeves thrown out.

2 CONC  hadn't seen her sister for years and usually pretended she didn't hav

2 CONT There was a note left with baby Harry by Albus Dumbledore, which expla
2 CONC ined that his parents Lily and James had been killed by Lord Voldemort
2 CONC , how Lily Potter had sacrificed herself to save her son's life and ho
2 CONC w living with his only other relatives would protect him from Lord Vol

1 NOTE It is revealed that, during his travels, Quirrell had met a barely-ali
2 CONC ve Voldemort. Voldemort, seeking to restore his physical form, entered
2 CONC  Quirrell as a host body, using him in a plan to steal the Philosopher
2 CONC 's Stone from vault 713 in Gringotts Bank, where it had been deposited
2 CONC  for safekeeping by Albus Dumbledore. Fortunately, Hagrid had removed 
2 CONC the Stone from the vault earlier that same day to take it to Hogwarts.
2 CONC  
2 CONT 
2 CONT To conceal the fact that Lord Voldemort's face was on the back of his 
2 CONC head, Quirrell decided to wear the turban, hiding its purpose with a s
2 CONC tory that it had been given to him by an African prince as a thank-you
2 CONC  for getting rid of a troublesome zombie. In order to keep Voldemort a
2 CONC live, he started killing unicorns in the Forbidden Forest and drinking
2 CONC  their blood.
2 CONT 
2 CONT On Halloween Quirrell let the troll in as a diversion, and went to the
2 CONC  third-floor corridor where the Stone was now hidden. Severus Snape, w
2 CONC ho already suspected Quirrell, went to the third floor in order to sto
2 CONC p him. Snape was bitten by Fluffy.
2 CONT 
2 CONT In order to figure out how to get past Fluffy, Quirrell got Hagrid dru
2 CONC nk, and gave him a dragon's egg, something Hagrid had always wanted. Q
2 CONC uirrell sent a letter to Dumbledore, telling him to go to the Ministry
2 CONC  of Magic; Quirrell took advantage of his absence to try to reach the 
2 CONC Stone, and was pursued - unwittingly, as they thought they were pursui
2 CONC ng Snape - by Harry, Ron and Hermione.
2 CONT 
2 CONT During Harry's final encounter with him - at which Voldemort reveals h
2 CONC imself on the back of Quirrell's head and speaks directly to Harry - Q
2 CONC uirrell is killed. Due to the lingering protection from Lily Potter's 
2 CONC sacrifice of love for her son, Quirrell is unable to touch Harry witho
2 CONC ut suffering extreme pain. Although Harry is rendered unconscious, he 
2 CONC holds off Quirrell long enough for aid to arrive, at which point Volde
2 CONC mort flees in his spirit form. His departure causes Quirrell's death,

1 NOTE Harry and his friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger believe Trelawn
2 CONC ey is a fraud, with which the teachers are inclined to agree. Her cred
2 CONC ibility as a Seer is undermined by her habit of making repeated predic
2 CONC tions each year that one of her students will die - pronouncements whi
2 CONC ch have never yet come true.
2 CONT 
2 CONT In Harry's third year (his first in Divination), Trelawney began to pr
2 CONC edict his imminent demise. During every class thereafter, she continue
2 CONC d to insinuate that his death could come at any time, to the great irr
2 CONC itation of Harry and his friends. Eventually, in part due to this habi
2 CONC t of Trelawney's, Hermione dropped the class. Harry and Ron continued 
2 CONC Divination studies until their fifth year, at the end of which they fa
2 CONC iled the exams and could not continue further - although neither was u
2 CONC pset about this.
2 CONT 
2 CONT In 1996, Professor Trelawney was put on probation by Dolores Umbridge,
2 CONC  Hogwarts High Inquisitor. This news pushed Trelawney into a spiral of
2 CONC  alcohol-induced paranoia, and she was subsequently seen around the sc
2 CONC hool clutching a bottle of cooking sherry and moaning about her victim
2 CONC isation at Umbridge's hands.
2 CONT 
2 CONT Her fears were proved justified when Umbridge dismissed Trelawney, alt
2 CONC hough Dumbledore exercised his remaining authority as Headmaster to pr
2 CONC event Umbridge from evicting Trelawney to boot. In Harry Potter and th
2 CONC e Half-Blood Prince it is revealed that Dumbledore feared for Trelawne
2 CONC y's safety if she ventured outside the school, since Lord Voldemort wo
2 CONC uld probably want to obtain from her the prediction she made concernin
2 CONC g him. Dumbledore employed a centaur named Firenze as Trelawney's repl
