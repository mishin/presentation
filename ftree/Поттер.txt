ind00001	M	Harry		Potter	Harry Potter is the central character of the Harry Potter series. He is a young wizard studying at Hogwarts School of Magic and Wizardry.   He has brilliant green eyes, the same as his mother’s, black hair, perpetually messy, sticks up in the back, same as his father's. He wears round glasses; he is short and thin, with knobbly knees. He has a lightning-bolt scar on forehead.

ind00002	M	Vernon		Dursley	Described as a big, beefy man, with hardly any neck, and a large mustache. He detests all magical things, especially his nephew Harry. He and his wife, Petunia, have grudgingly raised Harry from an early age, denying him any information about the magical world, including his parents. He reads the Daily Mail newspaper. 		2					N						2	pic00002, pic00039		ind00003	ind00026		ind00027			ind00025				ind00001, ind00004	35, 	, 	Drill-making company named "Grunnings"	Director	occu00011	edu00001	contact00001																								6	Muggle born	None	Richard Griffiths

ind00004	M	Dudley		Dursley	Harry's only cousin, he is described as a large blonde boy. He is completely spoiled, and he gets a horrible delight in bullying smaller kids, and shows a complete lack of sensitivity; he is also a glutton.  Dudley has been thoroughly spoiled since birth, getting mountains of birthday and Christmas presents and then throwing a tantrum because he wanted more, being given two bedrooms in the house, never using one, and then screaming when it is given to Harry and generally given his way in almost everything. He shows the symptoms of a brat from his first year itself, when a disgusted Professor McGonagall tells Dumbledore how she saw the toddler Dudley kicking his mother and screaming for sweets.  A rude, belligerent and selfish boy, Dudley is quite an unlikable character, although he knows how to be polite when he wants to make an impression (notably when his father's business associate came for dinner one evening). It can be inferred that he and Harry went to a private prep school in Surrey together, where Dudley and his gang of bullies ruled the school, and where the rest of the students shunned Harry as they knew Dudley hated him. With each passing year Dudley was overindulged in every way by his parents, which eventually made his morbidly obese and a careless student (he had reached the height and weight of a young killer whale at the beginning of the fourth book). Throughout their childhood together, Dudley would take any opportunity he could to humiliate and torment his cousin, Harry. Unlike his cousin, however, Dudley has no powers outside of his brutishness.		2					N						1	pic00003			ind00002		ind00003			ind00001										edu00002	contact00001																								5	Muggle born	None	Harry Melling

ind00008	M	Albus	Perceval Wulfric Brian	Dumbledore	Dumbledore  is one of the most respected men in the Wizarding world. Harry Potter looks to him as his protector and guide.  Dumbledore is described as tall and thin, with long white hair and a long beard. He has blue eyes, a very long and crooked nose (looking as if it had been broken at least twice) and long fingers. He wears half-moon spectacles. He claims to have a scar above his left knee, its provenance unknown, which happens to be a perfect map of the London Underground.  			1840		175		N						3	pic00001, pic00040, pic00041															Hogwarts	Headmaster	occu00002									Y																	5			Richard Harris (1-2), Michael Gambon (3-5)	Gryffindor
ind00009	M	Sirius		Black	Sirius was best friends with James Potter, Harry's father, and was also friends with Remus Lupin and Peter Pettigrew. When the group discovered that Lupin was a werewolf, they studied secretly to become Animagi in solidarity with Lupin, to keep him company during his transformations.  When the Potters went into hiding from Voldemort, they wanted to make Sirius their Secret-Keeper, but at the last minute he convinced them to appoint Pettigrew to the task instead, since no one would suspect such a move. Pettigrew immediately betrayed the Potters to Voldemort, and during the subsequent confrontation with Sirius, caused an explosion to fake his own death, killing twelve nearby Muggle bystanders in the process. Sirius was left framed for Pettigrew's "murder" and those of the bystanders, as well as the Potters' betrayal. In light of the overwhelming evidence against him, his guilt was assumed so completely (in particular by the ruthless Barty Crouch) that he was sent straight to Azkaban without trial and imprisoned there for twelve years, during which he endured relentless mental torture at the hands of the Azkaban guards, the dementors.  His later escape from prison led to the widest manhunt ever in the wizarding world (being the first person known to have escaped Azkaban, though in reality, he is second to Barty Crouch, Jr.), and he fled Europe for a time, only to return on Dumbledore's orders in The Order of the Phoenix, where he was forced to stay in his old family home, Grimmauld Place. It was impossible for The Order to reveal his location and prove him innocent for various reasons. His death at the end of The Order of the Phoenix, in the Ministry itself, led to Dumbledore explaining his story to the Minister of Magic. Tragically, Sirius was only recognized as innocent after his death.		1	7 Aug 1959	7 Aug	36y 10m		Y	Jun 1996				Y	1	pic00025			ind00038	30	ind00039	34		ind00040										edu00003	contact00003							Y																	7	Pure blood, Werewolf	Order of the Phoenix, Marauders	Gary Oldman (3-5)	Gryffindor

Hagrid is known for his thick West country accent.  Hagrid is romantically interested with Madame Maxime -- a half-giantess and headmistress of the French magic school Beauxbatons. Hagrid also has a half-brother, a giant named Grawp.			6 Dec 1928	6 Dec	86y 10m 8d		N						1	pic00017															Hogwarts	Care of Magical Creatures Professor	occu00003, occu00034	edu00034								Y																	6	Half-Giant, Half-Human Half-blood	Order of the Phoenix	Robbie Coltrane	Gryffindor

Aunt Marge usually brings her dog Ripper with her to Privet Drive – he pines when he is away from her – and treats him better than she treats most humans. While Aunt Marge is gone, Colonel Fubster takes care of her other dogs.

The werewolf Fenrir Greyback savaged Bill, albeit in his human form, and caused lycanthropy contamination to an unknown, partial extent. According to Remus Lupin, who is also a werewolf, this was not enough to cause actual transformations, though Bill has apparently developed a liking for extremely rare steaks and is left with a deeply scarred face. His and Fleur Delacour's plans to marry are unchanged.		1	29 Nov 1970	29 Nov	44y 10m 15d		N									ind00098	ind00029	30	ind00030	20		ind00036, ind00031, ind00032, ind00033, ind00016, ind00034							Gringotts	Curse breaker	occu00005	edu00009																									5	Pure blood	Order of the Phoenix	Richard Fish (cameo)	Gryffindor

In the portrait she appears as an hysterical woman in a black cap whose eyes are rolling and whose yellow-skinned face is stretched taught.

Harry stands up for his friends and refuses her invitation. Later in the year she attempts to trick Harry into taking a love potion, but while he takes the box of chocolates she gives him, he is wise enough not to eat them. Several months later, Ron Weasley accidentally eats several of Romilda's doctored chocolates and is affected by the love potion, forcing Harry to take him to Professor Slughorn for an antidote - which leads to Ron being poisoned by accident. Following Gryffindor's Quidditch victory towards the end of the book, Romilda is outraged to see Harry kissing Ginny Weasley, whom he starts dating shortly thereafter.			1982		33		N																									edu00003																									4				Gryffindor

ind00174	M	Gilderoy		Lockhart	He is a famous wizarding celebrity, having written many books on Dark Creatures and his encounters with them. He has blond, wavy hair and particularly straight and shiny teeth. He is narcissistic as he always thinks about beauty for himself, self-obsessed, and something of a buffoon. Despite his celebrity status amongst the wizarding community, his fan base consists mostly of middle-aged women and teenage girls.

ind00175	M	Remus		Lupin	Lupin was bitten by the vicious werewolf Fenrir Greyback as a young child (some believe his age to have been around 6), thus becoming a werewolf himself.			10 Mar 1958	10 Mar	57y 7m 4d		N						1	pic00071															Hogwarts	Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor	occu00040																										5	Half-blood, Werewolf	Order of the Phoenix	Davis Thewlis, James Utechin as a teenage Remus

ind00180	M	Horace		Slughorn	Slughorn is described as having prominent, pale-gooseberry eyes, a "shiny pate," and an "enormous, silver, walrus-like moustache." He is "enormously fat", but not very tall, reaching only up to Albus Dumbledore's chin. He considers himself to be an old man who suffers from a weak, wheezy chest and rheumatism.

ind00181	F	Sybill	Patricia	Trelawney	Her first name is spelled Sibyll in the United States.  Trelawney wears many gaudy bangles, cloaks and shawls, all covered with shining sequins. She also wears thick glasses, which cause her eyes to appear greatly magnified. She affects ethereal and misty tones when speaking. Her classroom is in the North Tower of Hogwarts. A fire is always going, scented quite heavily with perfumes that often make students either fall asleep or make wondrous predictions of the future.

ind00184	M	Alastor		Moody	Moody is horribly scarred, described as looking as if he had been carved out of wood by a person with only the crudest understanding of the human form. He has lost several body parts, including an eye, leg, and part of his nose in fighting practitioners of the Dark Arts, and is cautious—some might say paranoid— he refuses to eat or drink anything which he himself has not prepared 'as it is all too easy to poison an unattended cup.'

ind00185	P	Crookshanks			Hermione bought Crookshanks from a shop in Diagon Alley out of sympathy, as nobody wanted him due to his face, which looked squashed. Crookshanks had a habit of trying to hunt down the pet rat of Ron Weasley, Scabbers. Crookshanks is part Kneazle, giving an explanation for his higher than normal cat intelligence.							N						1	pic00075																																											4				
ind00186	P	Mrs Norris			Mrs Norris is Filch's cat. For the students, it's the "dearest ambition of many to give her a good kick". If Mrs Norris catches a student putting one toe out of line, Filch will arrive in seconds. The cat has been known to follow Hagrid everywhere when he goes up to the school, apparently under Filch's orders – which suggests an extraordinary connection between cat and owner, and makes Hagrid want to introduce her to Fang.

ind00191	P	Nagini			She is a giant, twelve-foot long snake and a loyal pet of Lord Voldemort, who as a Parselmouth, is quite capable of communicating with her.  Nagini seems to be the "evil" equivalent to Albus Dumbledore's phoenix Fawkes. Even more so, however, she seems to be Voldemort's spiritual familiar, sharing an intimate bond with her master.  In the sixth book, Dumbledore speculates that Nagini may be one of the six Horcruxes that Voldemort left behind to achieve immortality.							N																																																		3				
ind00192	P	Trevor			Trevor was given to Neville by his Uncle Algie upon Neville's gaining admission to Hogwarts. Neville loses him on a regular basis.							N																																																		3

ind00195	P	Fang			Fang is a large boarhound who, aside from his enormous size, appears to be an entirely ordinary dog. While Fang's appearance is intimidating, he is, in Hagrid's words, "a bloody coward". Boisterous and loving with people he knows, he seems especially fond of Harry.							N						1	pic00082																																											4				
ind00196	P	Fluffy			Fluffy is a giant three-headed dog used by Hagrid to guard the trapdoor leading to the underground chamber where the Philosopher's Stone is hidden. Music lulls him to sleep.							N						1	pic00083																																											4				
ind00197	P	Norbert			Norbert is a Norwegian Ridgeback dragon which Hagrid acquires as an egg and hatches himself. The Ministry of Magic classifies dragon eggs as Class A Non-Tradeable Goods. After hatching, he becomes very dangerous and bigger in the weeks following, so Harry, Ron, and Hermione persuade Hagrid to give him to Ron's older brother Charlie, who's studying dragons in Romania.							N						1	pic00084																										Y																	4				
ind00198																																													Y																					
ind00199	P	Buckbeak			He is sentenced to death after an attack on Draco Malfoy, which was provoked by Malfoy's disrespectful behaviour, but is rescued by Harry and Hermione and goes into hiding with Sirius Black at 12 Grimmauld Place.  After Sirius's death, Buckbeak returns to Hagrid's care, but is renamed Witherwings to hide his identity. As with all hippogriffs, Buckbeak is fond of eating small mammals, preferably ferrets. This is irony, as Mad-Eye Moody temporarily transforms Malfoy into a ferret the year after Draco had tried to get Buckbeak killed.							N						1	pic00085																										Y																	4				
ind00200																																													Y																					
ind00201	P	Hedwig			Hedwig is a gift to Harry from Hagrid in the first book of the series, purchased in Diagon Alley while shopping for supplies for Harry's first year at Hogwarts. In the series, owls are used by witches and wizards primarily as message and package couriers, which make owls more useful than the other pets allowed students (rats, toads and cats), so Hedwig is used for messages throughout the series.

ind00202	P	Peter		Pettigrew	Pettigrew had masqueraded as Scabbers, the pet rat owned at first by Percy Weasley, then by his brother Ron. It has not been revealed how Peter, as Scabbers, managed to get into the Weasley family. However, Pettigrew used his time with them to his advantage: he remained alert for any news about Voldemort or Black. None of the Weasleys took particular note that "Scabbers" outlived a common garden rat and had a missing toe.			1957		58		N						1	pic00076																																											4		Order of the Phoenix (formerly), Death Eaters (currently)	Timothy Spall, Charles Hughes (as teenage Peter) 	Gryffindor
ind00203	P	Errol			Errol is an old Great Grey owl belonging to the Weasley family. He has trouble carrying loads due to his advanced age, often needing help from other owls. He is often found unconscious after crashing into things or collapsing from sheer exhaustion. 							N																																																		3				
ind00204	M	Bloody Baron			He is the only person besides Dumbledore who can exert any control over the poltergeist Peeves, given how Peeves is terrified of him for some unknown reason; Refers to him as "Your Bloodiness" and "Mr. Baron."  The Baron is the Slythein ghost, and he is covered with silvery blood stains.							Y						1	pic00088																																											4			Terence Bayler	Slytherin
ind00205	M	Nicholas		de Mimsy-Porpington	Nearly Headless Nick is the Gryffindor ghost whose neck was almost completely severed in life (45 swings to the neck with a blunt axe), but not enough to join in the games of the Headless Hunt, a society of ghosts who had been decapitated on earth (a source of annual vexation to the ghost). Harry Potter becomes friends with Sir Nicholas when he attends his "deathday" party (the 500th anniversary of the event) in a Hogwarts dungeon.

ind00208	F	Myrtle			She is a ghost who haunts the second floor girls' lavatory at Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry. True to her nickname, Myrtle has a tendency to sob, whine, wail and complain. 							Y	13 Jun 1943																																																	3	Muggle born witch		Shirley Henderson	
ind00209	M	Peeves			Peeves is a poltergeist living in Hogwarts. He's a spirit rather than a physical being, but highly different from the ghosts he's occasionally mistaken for. Peeves is essentially an embodiment of disorder, and is constantly causing it, with varying amounts of mischievousness and malice. In appearance he's a small old man dressed in wildly coloured clothing. He's capable of flight and intangibility, like ghosts, but can also affect solid objects and make himself invisible.  He's usually far more annoying than legitimately dangerous, but acts in a wildly unpredictable manner and should not be given the chance to cause serious harm. It appears that his entire purpose is to cause disorder, break things, and be as annoying and disruptive as possible.  Peeves does not listen to Hogwarts prefects, teachers or anyone else, with the exception of Dumbledore and for some unknown reason the fearsome Bloody Baron. Argus Filch, who is usually left with cleaning up the mess and the damage Peeves causes, is his nemesis and works continuously to try to get Peeves thrown out.

Like Regulus Black, Draco is infatuated by the Dark Arts and eagerly takes on the task as a chance for glory, of which he seems to get very little. In an effort to prove himself, Draco works alone without the help of his cronies, Crabbe and Goyle, or his favourite professor, Severus Snape. Under his aunt Bellatrix Lestrange's instruction, Draco has become quite proficient in Occlumency, a skill that Harry has never mastered.  												ind00093	3

	Hogwarts	place00002		As Cho had a romantic interest in Harry Potter, who was at the centre of the Ministry's smear campaign, this left Marietta in a difficult position. Marietta joined Dumbledore's Army entirely because of peer pressure. Dumbledore's Army was doing the one thing the Ministry didn't want to happen; training students in combat.  Eventually, Marietta betrayed the D.A. to Umbridge; however, the parchment that all members had signed had been jinxed by Hermione, so she broke out with pustules which spelled the word, "SNEAK". Umbridge took Marietta to testify against Harry, but Kingsley Shacklebolt swiftly modified her memory, to keep Harry and his friends out of trouble.  												ind00155	3

Marcus Flint is a sixth year student in Harry's first year and is still in school two years later when he should have already finished school. Author J.K. Rowling explained this away by saying that he failed his exams[1]. In later printings of the first book, however, he is a Fifth Year. Explanation notwithstanding, Harry Potter fans have taken to calling minor textual errors in the series "flints," after this particular mistake.  												ind00164	3

	She obsessively follows news about divorced movie stars while sniffing, "as if we're interested in their sordid affairs".  At some point she met Vernon Dursley and married him.  Petunia Dursley hadn't seen her sister for years and usually pretended she didn't have one - The Evans sisters weren't talking as Lily Potter knew how her sister felt about her. However one day Petunia discovered her nephew Harry Potter on her doorstep as she put out the milk bottles.  There was a note left with baby Harry by Albus Dumbledore, which explained that his parents Lily and James had been killed by Lord Voldemort, how Lily Potter had sacrificed herself to save her son's life and how living with his only other relatives would protect him from Lord Voldemort. Petunia and Vernon agreed to raise Harry, but kept him as downtrodden as possible in order to squash the magic out of him; they never told him how his parents died, instead claiming they had died in a car crash.  When Petunia and her husband, Vernon, attempted to throw Harry out of their house at the beginning of Order of the Phoenix, she receives a Howler from Dumbledore – "Remember my last, Petunia", which JKR has confirmed is referring to the note he left with one-year-old Harry on their doorstep. Rowling has also said that Dumbledore had corresponded with Petunia before that. Aunt Petunia has, therefore, more knowledge about the wizarding world than she will admit. Furthermore, Petunia has proved she knows what dementors and Azkaban are, claiming to have overheard a conversation between Lily and an "awful boy" that might have been James Potter. Petunia normally refers to James using his name, leaving the possibility that she has met other wizards. 													ind00003	1

Headmistress	After Dumbledore left Hogwarts, Umbridge was installed as Headmistress. However, the Headmaster's office refused to open for her, and her tenure as Headmistress was characterized by rebellion by most of the student body and faculty.  Her time in Hogwarts is characterized by cruelty and physical punishments against students — she stands out especially for forcing Harry and Lee Jordan to write lines using a quill that magically causes the words to be cut into the skin on the back of the writer's hand, and uses his blood as ink. She also ordered the botched whipping of Fred and George Weasley, and eventually even planned to use the Unforgivable Cruciatus Curse in order to extract information from Harry.

High Inquisitor	Umbridge is appointed the first (and only) ever "Hogwarts High Inquisitor," in which position she is given extraordinary powers over the students, teachers and curriculum. Umbridge creates an Inquisitorial Squad, which is comprised entirely of Slytherins and rewards some students for reporting on others and sanctions them to act as enforcers of Umbridge's rules. By attempting to defame Harry Potter and censor word of the truth of Voldemort's return, Umbridge and Fudge frequently unintentionally help the Dark Lord and his followers.

Care of Magical Creatures Professor	She substituted for Hagrid when he was away from Hogwarts. she is a reasonably competent teacher, passing even Dolores Umbridge's inspection without incident. She seems always level-headed, cheerful and efficient, and fends off Umbridge's questions without losing her temper or incriminating anybody. She claims to be very happy with the way Dumbledore runs the school. In Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Harry trusts her enough to ask her to heal his owl Hedwig when she is injured. Nevertheless, he is always somewhat annoyed by the fact that she is a much better teacher than Hagrid, to whom Harry remains loyal no matter how close to fatal his classes may be.

Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor	Gilderoy Lockhart was exposed as a fraud when, trying to avoid travelling into the Chamber of Secrets, he revealed that he had not in fact performed all the amazing feats described in his books — instead, he had been stealing others' stories, placing memory charms on those people and taking credit for their accomplishments.

Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor	During his tenure, he gave Harry private lessons in casting the Patronus Charm, the only known means of defence against Dementors. His students, excepting a few from Slytherin, held him in extremely high regard and loved the hands-on style of his classes. He was considered by Harry and his friends to have been their best Defence teacher, although his competition was hardly stiff in this regard.		Hogwarts	place00002			1993	1994						ind00175	6

Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor	It is revealed that, during his travels, Quirrell had met a barely-alive Voldemort. Voldemort, seeking to restore his physical form, entered Quirrell as a host body, using him in a plan to steal the Philosopher's Stone from vault 713 in Gringotts Bank, where it had been deposited for safekeeping by Albus Dumbledore. Fortunately, Hagrid had removed the Stone from the vault earlier that same day to take it to Hogwarts.   To conceal the fact that Lord Voldemort's face was on the back of his head, Quirrell decided to wear the turban, hiding its purpose with a story that it had been given to him by an African prince as a thank-you for getting rid of a troublesome zombie. In order to keep Voldemort alive, he started killing unicorns in the Forbidden Forest and drinking their blood.  On Halloween Quirrell let the troll in as a diversion, and went to the third-floor corridor where the Stone was now hidden. Severus Snape, who already suspected Quirrell, went to the third floor in order to stop him. Snape was bitten by Fluffy.  In order to figure out how to get past Fluffy, Quirrell got Hagrid drunk, and gave him a dragon's egg, something Hagrid had always wanted. Quirrell sent a letter to Dumbledore, telling him to go to the Ministry of Magic; Quirrell took advantage of his absence to try to reach the Stone, and was pursued - unwittingly, as they thought they were pursuing Snape - by Harry, Ron and Hermione.  During Harry's final encounter with him - at which Voldemort reveals himself on the back of Quirrell's head and speaks directly to Harry - Quirrell is killed. Due to the lingering protection from Lily Potter's sacrifice of love for her son, Quirrell is unable to touch Harry without suffering extreme pain. Although Harry is rendered unconscious, he holds off Quirrell long enough for aid to arrive, at which point Voldemort flees in his spirit form. His departure causes Quirrell's death, hence Dumbledore's comment that Voldemort is as merciless to his followers as to his enemies.   		Hogwarts	place00002			1991	1992						ind00178	6

Potions Professor	During his long initial period of employment at Hogwarts, Slughorn taught several of the main characters in the Harry Potter story. Among his pupils were a young Severus Snape and Lily Evans, Harry's mother and one of Slughorn's favourite students, whom he repeatedly praises as "one of the brightest I ever taught...vivacious...charming...cheeky". Significantly, however, an earlier cohort of students included Tom Marvolo Riddle. On one occasion, Riddle questioned Slughorn about Horcruxes, artifacts which could act as vessels for pieces of a person's soul in order to grant immortality. Having learnt of the nature of Horcruxes, Riddle went on to perform the necessary Dark magic to create his own Horcruxes, which contributed to his formidable power in his later reign of terror under his assumed name of Lord Voldemort.

Potions Professor	Slughorn is keen to build connections, and makes a habit of hosting regular receptions for students who are famous, related to famous people, or gifted or talented in one way or another. Known as "The Slug Club", this coterie of students is at the core of Slughorn's constant round of dinners, parties and receptions. In this way he also demonstrates that he is prone to show a large amount of favouritism		Hogwarts	place00002			1996	1997						ind00180	6
Divination Professor	Harry and his friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger believe Trelawney is a fraud, with which the teachers are inclined to agree. Her credibility as a Seer is undermined by her habit of making repeated predictions each year that one of her students will die - pronouncements which have never yet come true.  In Harry's third year (his first in Divination), Trelawney began to predict his imminent demise. During every class thereafter, she continued to insinuate that his death could come at any time, to the great irritation of Harry and his friends. Eventually, in part due to this habit of Trelawney's, Hermione dropped the class. Harry and Ron continued Divination studies until their fifth year, at the end of which they failed the exams and could not continue further - although neither was upset about this.  In 1996, Professor Trelawney was put on probation by Dolores Umbridge, Hogwarts High Inquisitor. This news pushed Trelawney into a spiral of alcohol-induced paranoia, and she was subsequently seen around the school clutching a bottle of cooking sherry and moaning about her victimisation at Umbridge's hands.  Her fears were proved justified when Umbridge dismissed Trelawney, although Dumbledore exercised his remaining authority as Headmaster to prevent Umbridge from evicting Trelawney to boot. In Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince it is revealed that Dumbledore feared for Trelawney's safety if she ventured outside the school, since Lord Voldemort would probably want to obtain from her the prediction she made concerning him. Dumbledore employed a centaur named Firenze as Trelawney's replacement. Trelawney was reinstated after Umbridge was ousted from the school and returned to the Ministry of Magic. Much to her displeasure, Trelawney now shared responsibility for teaching Divination with Firenze.		Hogwarts	place00002			1979		17					ind00181	6

Apparation Teacher	Wilkie Twycross is a Ministry of Magic approved teacher, who teaches Hogwarts students over the age of 17, or students that will turn 17 before the upcoming school year, a twelve week course in apparation. He is much despised by students. He is also famous for teaching the method of the three D's (Destination, Deliberation and Determination), which is almost as unpopular as Wilkie Twycross himself.

Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor	Moody was appointed as the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts. Before the school year began, however, he was locked up in a chest by Barty Crouch Jr, a faithful follower of Voldemort, who used a Polyjuice Potion to take his form in order to replace him. Moody owes his life to the fact that one ingredient of the Polyjuice Potion is a part of the person whose form is to be assumed, such as a tuft of hair. Crouch Jr. needed to keep him alive, under the Imperius Curse, so he would be able to use his hair in the potion and question him. Moody's habit of carrying his own drink in a private hip flask allowed Crouch to take the Potion regularly without raising suspicion.		Hogwarts	place00002			1994	1995						ind00184	6
