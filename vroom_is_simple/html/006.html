     # To make this work, you will need Vroom 0.28 or later.  Slide notes are optional, but
     # recommended.  Slide titles won't be used for this application.
     #
     # Earlier versions of Vroom will work if you add the dashes in front of the vroom commands
     # (e.g. `vroom -compile` and `vroom -html`).  But the HTML is formatted a bit differently, so
     # I make no promises that it will come out looking as good as the newest versions.

     # You'll also need wkhtmltopdf.  If you don't have it, you can get it here:
     # http://code.google.com/p/wkhtmltopdf/
     #
     # Note that you will almost certainly need the static version in order to handle multiple HTML
     # files.  See the README file for full details:
     # https://github.com/antialize/wkhtmltopdf/blob/master/README_WKHTMLTOPDF


     # for some reason, just doing an ls of html/ doesn't get the slides in the right order
     # this seems to fix it
